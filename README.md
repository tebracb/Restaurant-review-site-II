# Restaurant-review - OpenClassrooms - Project 7
## Launch your own restaurant review site

This repo contains OpenClassrooms Project 7 - Restaurant-review App. The goal of this project was to integrate
external APIs such as Google Maps and Google Places to an application. I built the project with ReactJS.

### Requirements: 

* Use external APIs such as Google Maps, Google Places, and the Geolocation API
* Show nearby restaurants which are within the area displayed on the map as a list on the side 
* The map and list should be updated real-time to show the particular display area
* When the user clicks on a restaurant, the details of the restaurant, the list of reviews and the Google Street View photo has
to be shown
* Allow users to filter restaurants based on their average rating
* Users can add reviews to existing restaurants
* Users can add new restaurants to the map
* Some of the restaurants has to come from local JSON file
* The information (e.g new restaurant or review) does not have to be saved if user leaves the page 

### Extra features:
* Info-window on hover
* Instead of the static Google Street View photo I used Street View Panorama which allows 360 degree views

### Dependencies used
* React Ratings Declarative to display ratings and for filter tool
* react-streetview to be able to add Street View Panorama to my app

Develop a full JavaScript application according to a specification
Debug an application using DevTools


### Technologies:
* **ReactJS**, **create-react-app**
* APIs (**Geolocation API**, **Google Places API**, **Place Details API**, **Street View Panorama**) 
* interface created with **HTML** and **CSS**
